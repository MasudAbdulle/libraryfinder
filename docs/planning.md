This addresses a problem that many people have of finding open to use public libraries many people go to only one or two libraries by using this app it will allow them to experience many diiferent libraries. They can find the one that suits them the most based of location,size or facilites in the library e.g types of computers, silent working spaces and team work spaces. By creating this app library Finder we aim to help everyone find the best libraries for them.
