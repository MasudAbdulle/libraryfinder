# Library Finder

## Business Case

### Problem statement
Our Project is called library finder. It is an app that allows people to find the nearest library to them based on their location. This addresses a problem that many people have of finding open to use public libraries. Many people go to only one or two libraries and by using this app it will allow them to experience many diiferent libraries. They can find the one that suits them the most based of location,size or facilites in the library e.g types of computers, silent working spaces and team work spaces. By creating this app library Finder we aim to help everyone find the best libraries for them and make it easier for them to find library spaces that suit their needs.

### Business benefits
Library finder will have many benefits for users including:
1. Finding the closest library can help people with travel costs etc
2. Users can find libraries close to them while on the move.
3. Users can decide if they want to go to that library based on the facilites there.
4. Users can see distances inbetween their current location and their library of choice.

### Options Considered
TODO: What are some other customer options or leading products that address the same needs?
There are no leading mobile apps that specifically find libraries for users, however google serching libraries near me could address the same needs. However there are some issues that could arise from this e.g. google could show all libraries including private libraires such as school and university facilites. 

### Expected Risks
TODO: What are the main risks of this project?
One of the risks associated with launching an app is the cost. Apps can be expensive to start up and more expensive to maintain. Another risk associated with launching our app is that it may grow too fast making it diificult to maintain and accomodate possibly hundereds of thounsands of users weekly/monthly. This can cause an issue that we are not prepared for. Another issue is that users may struggle to take to our new app. According to Buildfire Mobile App Download and Usage Statistics (2021) the average person only uses 9 apps per day. This is a very small amount and it may become difficult for our app to become an app the average person uses regularly.
