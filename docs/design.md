# Design

## Behavioural design
TODO: Describe a concrete scenario for each use-case. 
Describe it in terms of interactions between the components introduces above, and the actors introduced in your requirements.

UC1 - Abdi
The user requests to see a map of libraries. Then the library map finder client will communicate with the server and database through a query. Once this has happened a returned message will give the client a set of libraries, which will then be portrayed on a map for the client.
